# Universal-Shift-Register-and-Johnson-Counter
The register and counter circuit are simulated and designed using four 4:1 MUX which is used to select the operations (like SISO, PISO, PIPO, SIPO), IC555 timer is used to give clock pulse and D flip-flops along with combinational circuits are used to shift the data and perform the particular operation. The output is taken through series of LED.
